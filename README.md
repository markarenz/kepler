# Kepler Brahe

This is a single page presentation about Johannes Kelper created in scrollmagic.io. 

Note: Some of the segments were based on a sketch I wrote for the podcast Machine Court in 2013.

Since then, I read Kitty Ferguson's book Tycho & Kepler, a fantastic read, and found that I may have oversimplified
(definitely did oversimplify) some of the elements of Kepler & Brahe's relationship for the sake of a joke. In truth,
Brahe's title of "the world's most baller astronomer" is not in doubt. However, his story is far more nuanced and
interesting than I'd understood based on what I'd read previously. Also, the "he lost his nose in a duel over a math
equation" is greatly oversimplified. He was, as it happens, defending his honor as an astrologer when he lost his nose.
Yes, much like alchemists eventually became chemists and astrologers eventually became astronomers, Brahe lived at a
time when people who studied the heavens had to earn their keep by making predictions. Some of them even came true, 
all of which says a great deal about public attitudes regarding the sciences and their application, both in Brahe's
time and in ours.
